/* This program will work fine on x86 architecture, but will crash on x86_64 architecture.
 * Let us see what was wrong with code. Carefully go through the program, deliberately I
 * haven’t included prototype of “strerror()” function. This function returns “pointer to
 * character”, which will print error message which depends on errno passed to this function.
 * Note that x86 architecture is ILP-32 model, means integer, pointers and long are 32-bit
 * wide, that’s why program will work correctly on this architecture. But x86_64 is LP-64 model,
 * means long and pointers are 64 bit wide. In C language, when we don’t provide prototype of
 * function, the compiler assumes that function returns an integer. In our example, we haven’t
 * included “string.h” header file (strerror’s prototype is declared in this file), that’s why
 * compiler assumed that function returns integer. But its return type is pointer to character.
 * In x86_64, pointers are 64-bit wide and integers are 32-bits wide, that’s why while returning
 * from function, the returned address gets truncated (i.e. 32-bit wide address, which is size of
 * integer on x86_64) which is invalid and when we try to dereference this address, the result is
 * segmentation fault.
